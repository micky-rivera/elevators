todo:
- fix double logging of calls because of desync with server
    - server should be able to tell which are in process and which are completed and present it neatly for the FE
    - completed calls should be displayed differently

- fix flipped floor values

- display floor numbers

- idle elevators dont always get priority for some reason

- should be able to change number of elevators on the screen

- maybe some cheeky art

- ultra refactor
