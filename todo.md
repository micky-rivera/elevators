todo:

- fix flipped floor values
    - probably done using a shitty utility function that converts y position to floor number


backlog:

- completed calls should be displayed differently
    - when completed, they should be greyed out and have a (completed) tag on them

- should be able to change number of elevators on the screen
    - need to not take up the full 600px width, so even if there are 1000 elevators, they dont cover the floor number

- maybe some cheeky art
    - pixel art might be unprofesh, idk

- change js files to ts files
    - emphasize the type usage

- dockerize and deploy on heroku

- clear calls button

- reset elevators button

- fix css of page
