todo:
- elevator should be idle only if calls list is empty
- elevator should cycle through its calls list and complete the stops
- elevator should spend a couple seconds making a stop

- instantiate 3 elevators
- give a shitload of random calls and see what breaks

- create a background that more clearly shows the floors
